🗽 NYC Airbnb Data Analysis Project
This project presents a complete end-to-end data analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City using SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Power BI. It focuses on extracting meaningful insights related to price distribution, neighborhood popularity, host behavior, and availability, ultimately helping stakeholders understand the dynamics of the NYC short-term rental market.

🔍 Project Objectives
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Uncover patterns in pricing, room types, and availability
Identify top-performing neighborhoods and hosts
Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders
Practice cross-platform data storytelling using SQL, Python, and Power BI

🗂️ Tools & Technologies
SQL: Data querying, filtering, joins, and aggregations
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA and visualizations
